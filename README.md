This is a collection of themes for [BlogA](https://github.com/BlogTANG/blog-a).

## How To Use

First, clone the theme repo to your local.

```sh
cd blog-a/themes
git clone https://github.com/BlogTANG/blog-t -b branch-name theme-name
```

The `branch-name` here is the branch which contains the theme you want, and `theme-name` is your local theme name. You can just make them the same.

Then, configure the `config.py`'s `theme` property, make it the theme name you want to use, and run the following command to apply the change:

```py
python app.py apply-theme
```

After all the above, you can now run your own BlogA instance with your favourite theme.
